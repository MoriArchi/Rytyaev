  So, about 8 years ago, my father bought the house of Mikhail Rytyaev (Михаил Рытяев) - a theater artist, painter, sculptor (a short biography of the artist will be below). The interior was partially lost over the years - [here](https://ibb.co/album/bFBHpm) you can see a couple of photos from about 2012 (in some photos Rytyaev himself), and [here](https://ibb.co/album/tM4PCT) are photos of the interior that I have taken at the moment. You can see the furniture made by Mikhail's brother - [Dmitry]( https://www.instagram.com/woodinhands). Recently I found a portfolio with probably Dmitry's works - which I publish now on Rarible.

  Mikhail Rytyaev himself is undoubted Robinson: his small island is hung with fishing nets, lifebuoys, pirate sabers. Everything was saved from the studio on Pyatnitskaya torpedoed by Moscow bankers. For a long time, his "island" was a meeting place for various representatives of the cultural society of Dnepropetrovsk and the post-Soviet space in general.

  Until 1971 he worked as a theater designer in Ukraine. Then he moved to Moscow, where he worked as the chief artist of the Moscow theater "Hermitage".
Since 1976 freelance artist.

  Mikhail Rytyaev's works are in the Lviv Museum of Ukrainian Art, the Muranovo Tyutchev Estate Museum, the Voronezh Regional Museum of Fine Arts, the Vologda Museum, as well as in the Karen Berne galleries (London), "369" (Edinburgh), the Seibelman Gallery (Mainz) and private collections in Russia, USA, Japan, Finland, Germany.
